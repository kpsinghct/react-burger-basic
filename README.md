## Backend
1. We are using google's firebase for our backend.  You need to create new project at https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ and select Database from lefthand side menu bar and create new real time database. After database creation set rules public, if you dont want to it private. In private you need to authencticate before connecting database. So If you want to public you databse then use below database rules:-  

```
{
  /* Visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security to learn more about security rules. */
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```
2.  Create two tables there names ```orders``` and ```ingredients```. 

3.  Add below default values in ```ingredients```  table:- 
  ```{
        salad:0,
        bacon:0,
        cheese:0,
        meat:0
       }
 ```
    
4. Now Copy base url which may like https://YOURPROJECTNAME.firebaseio.com  and add it in your code file name axios-order.js in src folder.
